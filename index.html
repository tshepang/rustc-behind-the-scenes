# behind the scenes of producing an executable

Tshepang Lekhonkhobe

@tshepang_dev

???

I proposed this talk knowing that it was rather ambitious for me
actually, considering I've never worked with compilers before.

And indeed at this point there's some details that aren't exactly clear to
me.

So, if it turns out I got stuff not quite right (or just utterly
wrong), please say something after the talk... I will be happy to
learn.

***

Interestingly, I spend some time yesterday talking to 2 people who
understand these things thoroughly... one was on a V8 team at Google,
and another is an expert on Rust macros.

They happened to actually talk this stuff, and of course I
felt inadequate... they should be the ones giving this talk.
I was also honored to be in the presence of such,
and which I understood everything they said.

# about

- I studied electronics formally, but prefer software

- I was a Python fan, and now Rust

- I am part of a tiny team at https://panoptix.co.za,
  building a distributed data processing framework

???

- By tiny I mean 3 people, all enthusiastic Rust users

- Company is based in Johannesburg

- As a note, it would be kool to know of others taking such a
  commitment (full time Rust dev) on the language elsewhere on the
  continent

The steps taken to get to a working executable

- parsing -> AST
- AST processing
- lowering -> HIR
- type checking
- lowering -> MIR
- borrow checking [+ optimization]
- translation -> llvm-ir
- code generation -> object files (.o)
- linking -> "the executable"

???

That second step, I actually don't know if

---
class: middle, left

### Parsing

The source code is turned into 'meaningful' structure,
known as Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Individual parts of this tree are known as tokens.

Examples of tokens:

- StructField
- WhereClause
- Block '{}'
- Arm (of a match)
- Expr

???

These are the type names in the compiler.

Remember that structs are sometimes composed of fields.


---
class: middle, left

### AST processing

- code elimination (cfg)

- macro expansion

- name resolution

Note that these are not necessarily sequential, and at times work
together, and sometimes each goes through multiple passes.

---
class: middle, left

### code elimination

cfg attribute allows for conditional compilation.

This is kool in that you can keep such things, which should ideally be
minimal, in the same codebase.

A major example is having code meant to be compiled for Windows (for
example where you accessing certain resources applicable only to that
OS).

That will be as simple as annotating the code with `#[cfg(windows)]`.

Given that example, what code elimination does is remove that code in
the case you were compiling for Unix.

???

cfg is equivalent to C/C++ ifdef

---
class: middle, left

### code elimination

A real example:

```rust
fn display_human(result: mrh::Output) {
    #[cfg(windows)]
    ansi_term::enable_ansi_support().unwrap();
    print!("{}", result.path.display());
    ...
```

???

That example is from a crate I wrote...
when built for Windows, that cfg annotates code that allows color
output on a Windows terminal.


---
class: middle, left

### macro expansion

There's a few forms of macros

- Derive, example being to apply Debug implementation to types

- Function-like, examples being `println!` and `assert_eq!`

- Attribute, example being structopt notation

---
class: middle, left

### macro expansion

Example of Functional-like expansion:

```rust
assert_eq!(1, 1);
```

Following is the code that gets generated (macro expansion) as a result...

---
class: middle, left

```rust
match (&1, &1) {
  (left_val, right_val) => {
    if !(*left_val == *right_val) {
      {
        ::panicking::panic_fmt(
          <::fmt::Arguments>::new_v1_formatted(
            &[
              "assertion failed: `(left == right)`\n left: `",
              "`,\n right: `",
              "`",
            ],
            &match (&left_val, &right_val) {
              (arg0, arg1) => [
                <::fmt::ArgumentV1>::new(arg0, ::fmt::Debug::fmt),
                <::fmt::ArgumentV1>::new(arg1, ::fmt::Debug::fmt),
              ],
[snip]
```
???

yeees, hard on the eyes

---
class: middle, left

### macro expansion

Example of Attribute macro:

```rust
#[structopt(
    long = "ignore-untracked",
    help = "Do not include untracked files in output",
)]
ignore_untracked: bool,
```

???

That generates clap (command line argument parser lib) code


---
class: middle, left

### macro expansion

That generates similar to the following:

``` rust
let app: structopt::clap::App = ...
let arg: structopt::clap::Arg = app.arg(
    structopt::clap::Arg::with_name("ignore_uncommitted_repos")
        .takes_value(false)
        .multiple(false)
        .long("ignore-uncommited-repos")
        .help("Do not include repos that have no commits"),
);
```

---
class: middle, left

### name resolution

Rust allows you to use the same names to different things,
even in the same scope.

What name resolution does is doing the disambiguation.

As an example, this code is valid:

```rust
type x = u32;
let x: x = 1;
let y: x = 2;
```

Also:

- Variable shadowing

- Suggestions for typo fixes

- Suggestions for traits to import

???

Tha nice example is from the compiler guide

### lowering to HIR

HIR: high-level intermediate representation

Lowering is conversion from one form to something more simple.

In our case, the AST is converted to the HIR

Type checking operates on the HIR.


---
class: middle, left

### HIR howto

Following is the command that will show what HIR looks like:

    cargo rustc -- -Zunpretty=hir

The data structure of HIR itself is interesting, and you use the
following command to check it out:

    cargo rustc -- -Zunpretty=hir-tree

???

The unpretty-ness of it is actually curious.
I mean the output is not pretty, but I don't think that is what was meant.

---

### digression: RISC-V

- A new ISA, born in 2010
- It's a more clean design compared the alternatives
- It's also libre (no royalty/licensing fee)

Note: Rust RISC-V targets has no libstd support,
so you won't be able to run this on Linux for example.

???
It was an explicit decision by its designers to avoid issue with
earlier ISAs

Being libre allows all manner of (motivated) people to play in the CPU
design space, not just those with sizable pockets.

Those last 2 points, the design and the libre-ness of it made it
attractive to me.

---
class: middle, left

### one more digression: RISC-V
There are three base forms:

- RV32I
- RV64I
- RV128I

There are called Integer Instruction Sets.

This has instructions to do...

- memory reads/writes
- simple arithmetic (addition and subtraction)
- logical operations
- branching (jumps to other instructions)

As for difference between the 3, RV128I (128-bit) has additional
instructions comapred to RV64I, which allow it to work with larger
(128-bit) integers and memory (unimaginable).

RV64I itself will similarly have additional instructions compared to RV32I.

???

Note that all software should be able to run on processors
implementing any of these 2 base variants.

Most of anything else can be simulated, but that's not good enough,
because speed.

---
class: middle, left

### last bit of digression: RISC-V

The ISA is also modular, and Rust currently supports 2 variants:

- riscv32imac (official name is RV32IMAC)
- riscv32imc (official name is RV32IMC)

What are those letters:

- I is the base that all complying implemetations must support, explained above
- M is Multiply extension (has multiplication and division operations)
- A is Atomic extension (for atomic memory operations)
- C is Compressed extension (to reduce code size)

???

A extension support in llvm, which Rust uses to produce the final
code, is not complete.
GCC is ahead on this front.

---
class: middle, left

Here is some code

```rust
#![no_std]

extern crate hifive;

pub fn square(num: u32) -> u32 {
    num * num
}

fn main() {
    square(1983);
}
```

???

I chose something simple so that things are clear, but that only
worked to some extent.

That first line indicates that we are choosing a bare-metal (i.e. no
OS is to be used).

That second line does some magical things that allow this to be ran on
a hifive board, which happens to be among the few physical RISC-V
development boards in production.

Would be kool to see Jonathan (Monotrom fame) play with one of these.

---
class: middle, left

### HIR output

```rust
#![no_std]
#[prelude_import]
use core::prelude::v1::*;
#[macro_use]
extern crate core;
#[macro_use]
extern crate compiler_builtins;

extern crate hifive;

pub fn square(num: u32) -> u32 {
    num * num
}

fn main() {
    square(1983);
}
```

???

So, that exposes some things that were hidden, like the libcore, the
prelude, and compiler builtins.

As for our code, nothing fancy happened, hence it was left
alone... it's simple enough for HIR purposes.

---
class: middle, left

### What happens during HIR stage

- type inference

- type checking

- trait resolution

???
This list is not comprehensive. To see the true detail, you must take
a look the HIR tree

---
class: middle, left

### Snippet of hir-tree output

How the body of the `square` function is represented (`num * num`)

```rust
BodyId {
    node_id: NodeId(24)
}: Body {
    arguments: [
        Arg {
            pat: pat(9: num),
            id: NodeId(8),
            hir_id: HirId {
                owner: DefIndex(0:5),
                local_id: ItemLocalId(6)
            }
        }
    ],
    value: expr(24: { num * num }),
    is_generator: false
},
```

???

The sample code produced a 500-line data structure, whose top-level
name is Crate, It's actually Debug println of the data structure that
the compiler operates on.

Anyways, the snippet above represents the body part of the function 'square`.

---

### MIR

MIR: medium-level intermediate representation

This is an even more simple representation of HIR.
As an example, loops and matches are replaced with gotos.

???
It's called medium because it sits between HIR and llvm-ir

gotos are pretty much how assembly instructions do branching
(as you will see shortly)

---
class: middle, left

### what happens on MIR

The main part that happens is borrow checking, and following is some
of what that entails:

- vars can't be used uninitialised
- vars can't be accessed once moved
- vars can't be moved while still borrowed
- vars can't be accessed while still mutably borrowed

What else:
- pre-llvm optimization
- output is llvm-ir (Intermediate Representation)

???
borrow checking is a critical part of what makes Rust a
special and unique snowflake... compile time memory safety

That list is stolen from the rustc guide

Actually not sure what comes out of MIR stage is llvm-ir or the
bitcode, which is the binary representation of that ir.

---
class: middle, left

### MIR output

```rust
fn square(_1: u32) -> u32{
    let mut _0: u32;
    let mut _2: u32;
    let mut _3: u32;
    let mut _4: (u32, bool);

    bb0: {
        StorageLive(_2);
        _2 = _1;
        StorageLive(_3);
        _3 = _1;
        _4 = CheckedMul(move _2, move _3);
        assert(!move (_4.1: bool), "attempt to multiply with overflow") -> bb1;
    }

    bb1: {
        _0 = move (_4.0: u32);
        StorageDead(_3);
        StorageDead(_2);
        return;
    }
}
```

???
Note pretty, but the simpler representation makes things more easy to
perform the operations mentioned before.

Scanning this, looking inside the bb0 block, where the action is
taking place.

---
class: middle, left

### llvm-ir output

Just a snippet...

```llvm-ir
define internal i32 @square(i32 %num) unnamed_addr #0 {
start:
  %0 = call { i32, i1 } @llvm.umul.with.overflow.i32(i32 %num, i32 %num)
  %1 = extractvalue { i32, i1 } %0, 0
  %2 = extractvalue { i32, i1 } %0, 1
  %3 = call i1 @llvm.expect.i1(i1 %2, i1 false)
  br i1 %3, label %panic, label %bb1
}
```

???
Output of that is rather verbose... 75 lines

---
class: middle, left

### and finally, assembly

Just a snippet...

```
square:
	addi	sp, sp, -16
	sw	ra, 12(sp)
	mul	a1, a0, a0
	mv	a2, a0
	mulhu	a0, a0, a0
	mv	a3, zero
	sw	a2, 8(sp)
	sw	a1, 4(sp)
	bne	a0, a3, .LBB1_2
	j	.LBB1_1
```

The calling code:

```
main:
	addi	sp, sp, -16
	sw	ra, 12(sp)
	addi	a0, zero, 1983
	call	square
	sw	a0, 8(sp)
	j	.LBB2_1
```

???
Note that there was cheating involved here, where I demangled some
stuff, for the sake of clarity

It's was a long time dream to give a talk at a conference, and it took
RustFest Paris to actually do it.

I find they did a great job of encouraging first-time speakers to
submit, which I did (and of course got rejected).

I think I proceeded to submit to Rustconf as well,
then finally to Rust Belt Rust, and scored.
