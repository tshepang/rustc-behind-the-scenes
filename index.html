# behind the scenes of producing an executable

Tshepang Lekhonkhobe

@tshepang_dev

???

I proposed this talk knowing that it was rather ambitious for me
actually, considering I've never worked with compilers before.

And indeed at this point there's some details that aren't exactly clear to
me.

So, if it turns out I got stuff not quite right (or just utterly
wrong), please say something after the talk... I will be happy to
learn.

***

Interestingly, I spend some time yesterday talking to 2 people who
understand these things thoroughly... one was on a V8 team at Google,
and another is an expert on Rust macros.

They happened to actually talk this stuff, and of course I
felt inadequate... they should be the ones giving this talk.
I was also honored to be in the presence of such,
and which I understood everything they said.

# about

- I studied electronics formally, but prefer software

- I was a Python fan, and now Rust

- I am part of a tiny team at https://panoptix.co.za,
  building a distributed data processing framework

???

- By tiny I mean 3 people, all enthusiastic Rust users

- Company is based in Johannesburg

- As a note, it would be kool to know of others taking such a
  commitment (full time Rust dev) on the language elsewhere on the
  continent

The steps taken to get to a working executable

- parsing -> AST
- AST processing
- lowering -> HIR
- type checking
- lowering -> MIR
- borrow checking [+ optimization]
- translation -> llvm-ir
- code generation -> object files (.o)
- linking -> "the executable"

???

That second step, I actually don't know if

### Parsing

The source code is turned into 'meaningful' structure,
known as Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Individual parts of this tree are known as tokens.

Examples of tokens:

- StructField
- WhereClause
- Block '{}'
- Arm (of a match)
- Expr

???

These are the type names in the compiler.

Remember that structs are sometimes composed of fields.

### AST processing

- code elimination (cfg)

- macro expansion

- name resolution

Note that these are not necessarily sequential, and at times work
together, and sometimes each goes through multiple passes.

---

### code elimination

cfg attribute allows for conditional compilation.

This is kool in that you can keep such things, which should ideally be
minimal, in the same codebase.

A major example is having code meant to be compiled for Windows (for
example where you accessing certain resources applicable only to that
OS).

That will be as simple as annotating the code with `#[cfg(windows)]`.

Given that example, what code elimination does is remove that code in
the case you were compiling for Unix.

???

cfg is equivalent to C/C++ ifdef

### code elimination

A real example:

```rust
fn display_human(result: mrh::Output) {
    #[cfg(windows)]
    ansi_term::enable_ansi_support().unwrap();
    print!("{}", result.path.display());
    ...
```

???

That example is from a crate I wrote...
when built for Windows, that cfg annotates code that allows color
output on a Windows terminal.

### macro expansion

There's a few forms of macros

- Derive, example being to apply Debug implementation to types

- Function-like, examples being `println!` and `assert_eq!`

- Attribute, example being structopt notation

---

### macro expansion

Example of Functional-like expansion:

```rust
    assert_eq!(1, 1);
```

Following is the code that gets generated (macro expansion) as a result...

---
class: middle, left

```rust
match (&1, &1) {
  (left_val, right_val) => {
    if !(*left_val == *right_val) {
      {
        ::panicking::panic_fmt(
          <::fmt::Arguments>::new_v1_formatted(
            &[
              "assertion failed: `(left == right)`\n left: `",
              "`,\n right: `",
              "`",
            ],
            &match (&left_val, &right_val) {
              (arg0, arg1) => [
                <::fmt::ArgumentV1>::new(arg0, ::fmt::Debug::fmt),
                <::fmt::ArgumentV1>::new(arg1, ::fmt::Debug::fmt),
              ],
[snip]
```
???

yeees, hard on the eyes

---

### macro expansion

Example of Attribute macro:

```rust
#[structopt(
    long = "ignore-untracked",
    help = "Do not include untracked files in output",
)]
ignore_untracked: bool,
```

???

That generates clap (command line argument parser lib) code


---
class: middle, left

### macro expansion

That generates similar to the following:

``` rust
let app: structopt::clap::App = ...
let arg: structopt::clap::Arg = app.arg(
    structopt::clap::Arg::with_name("ignore_uncommitted_repos")
        .takes_value(false)
        .multiple(false)
        .long("ignore-uncommited-repos")
        .help("Do not include repos that have no commits"),
);
```

---

### name resolution

Rust allows you to use the same names to different things,
even in the same scope.

What name resolution does is doing the disambiguation.

As an example, this code is valid:

```rust
type x = u32;
let x: x = 1;
let y: x = 2;
```

Also:

- Variable shadowing

- Suggestions for typo fixes

- Suggestions for traits to import

???

Tha nice example is from the compiler guide

### lowering to HIR

HIR: high-level intermediate representation

Lowering is conversion from one form to something more simple.

In our case, the AST is converted to the HIR

Type checking operates on the HIR.

It's was a long time dream to give a talk at a conference, and it took
RustFest Paris to actually do it.

I find they did a great job of encouraging first-time speakers to
submit, which I did (and of course got rejected).

I think I proceeded to submit to Rustconf as well,
then finally to Rust Belt Rust, and scored.
